### Hi there sou Juliana Santana 👋 


- 🔭 I’m currently working on Hospidata as a junior testing analyst.

- 🌱 I’m learning about API testing and improving my knowledge of automated testing.
- 👯 I am looking to collaborate with the community on software quality testing.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to learn new things, especially in the area of ​​software quality. Watch Netflix, read about market news, and study.
