### Hi there sou Juliana Santana ðŸ‘‹ 



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Hospidata as a Junior Testing Analyst.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to learn new things, especially in the area of â€‹â€‹software quality. Watch series, read about market news, and study.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning about API testing and improving my knowledge of automated testing.

- ðŸ‘¯ I am looking to collaborate with the community on software quality testing.
