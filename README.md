### Hi there sou Juliana Santana ğŸ‘‹ 

- I am that person who works to improve the quality of the software, finding the bug's contained since the beginning of its development.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently on Hospidata

- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to learn new things, especially in the area of â€‹â€‹software quality. Watch series, read about market news, and study.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning about API testing and improving my knowledge of automated testing.

- ğŸ‘¯ I am looking to collaborate with the community on software quality testing.
