### Hi there sou Juliana Santana ðŸ‘‹ 
**julianacarlas/julianacarlas** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Hospidata
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about API testing and improving my knowledge of automated testing.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on with knowledge about software quality testing.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliana-santana-/ 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to learn new things, especially in the area of â€‹â€‹software quality. Watch Netflix, read about market news, and study.
